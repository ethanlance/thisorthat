# ThisOrThat

ThisOrThat is a social polling platform designed to reduce decision anxiety through fun, time-limited polls with character interactions. The platform focuses on friend groups rather than public social media, creating intimate polling experiences that help people make decisions in an overwhelming world of choices. Key features include 24-hour time-limited polls, real-time voting with comments, and a character system that reacts to voting results.

The project is currently in early development with an MVP roadmap focusing on web and mobile web applications, simple poll creation, and invite-only access control. For a detailed overview of the MVP concept and development approach, please read the elevator pitch in [docs/elevator-pitch.md](docs/elevator-pitch.md).
