# Story 5.10: Offline Support

## Overview

Implement comprehensive offline support that allows users to continue using the platform even when they have limited or no internet connectivity. This includes offline poll viewing, cached content, background sync, and graceful degradation of features.

## User Stories

### As a user with poor connectivity

- I want to view polls I've already seen even when offline
- I want to vote on polls and have my votes saved for when I'm back online
- I want to create polls offline and have them posted when I reconnect
- I want to see clear indicators of what's available offline

### As a mobile user

- I want the app to work on the subway or in areas with spotty coverage
- I want to continue using the app during network interruptions
- I want my data to sync automatically when I reconnect
- I want to know when I'm offline and what I can still do

### As a frequent user

- I want my favorite polls and recent activity cached for offline access
- I want to browse my poll history even without internet
- I want to manage my profile and settings offline
- I want to see my voting history and statistics offline

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Cached Poll Viewing**
   - Previously viewed polls are available offline
   - Poll images and content are cached locally
   - Vote counts and results are cached for offline viewing
   - Poll metadata and descriptions are stored locally

2. **Offline Poll Creation**
   - Users can create polls while offline
   - Poll drafts are saved locally with images
   - Created polls are queued for upload when online
   - Users can edit and manage offline poll drafts

3. **Offline Voting**
   - Users can vote on cached polls while offline
   - Votes are stored locally and synced when online
   - Vote conflicts are resolved intelligently
   - Users see their offline votes reflected in the UI

### Background Sync & Data Management

4. **Automatic Sync**
   - Data syncs automatically when connection is restored
   - Background sync handles poll creation and voting
   - Sync conflicts are resolved with user-friendly notifications
   - Sync status is clearly communicated to users

5. **Data Caching Strategy**
   - Intelligent caching of frequently accessed content
   - Cache expiration and refresh policies
   - Storage quota management and cleanup
   - Selective caching based on user behavior

6. **Offline Data Management**

   - Clear indicators of what's available offline
   - Option to download specific polls for offline access
   - Cache size monitoring and management

### User Experience & Interface

7. **Offline Indicators**
   - Clear visual indicators when the app is offline
   - Different UI states for online vs offline content
   - Sync status and progress indicators
   - Network status and connectivity information

8. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Features gracefully degrade when offline
   - Clear messaging about offline limitations
   - Alternative actions available for offline users
   - Helpful guidance for offline usage

9. **Offline-First Design**
   - App works primarily from cached data
   - Network requests enhance rather than enable functionality
   - Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
   - Seamless transition between online and offline states

### Sync & Conflict Resolution

10. **Intelligent Sync**
    - Smart conflict resolution for votes and poll updates
    - Prioritization of user actions over server data
    - Batch operations for efficient sync
    - Retry logic for failed sync operations

11. **Data Integrity**
    - Consistent data state across online and offline
    - Prevention of data loss during sync
    - Validation of synced data
    - Rollback capabilities for failed syncs

12. **User Control**
    - Users can manually trigger sync operations
    - Control over what data is cached and synced
    - Option to work entirely offline when desired
    - Clear sync history and status information
