# Story 6.1: Live Demo Poll Component & Core Homepage Redesign

## User Story

As a **first-time visitor to ThisOrThat**,
I want **to immediately see and interact with a working poll on the homepage**,
So that **I understand what the product does within 3 seconds and can experience its value before reading any text**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing poll viewing components (`PollViewer`, `PollCard`) and real-time voting system
- Technology: Next.js 14+ App Router, React Server/Client Components, Tailwind CSS, Supabase Realtime
- Follows pattern: Existing poll viewing patterns from `/poll/[id]/page.tsx`
- Touch points: Homepage (`app/page.tsx`), poll API routes (`/api/polls`), Supabase Realtime subscriptions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Full-Viewport Demo Poll Display**
   - Homepage replaces static hero section with interactive, full-screen poll card
   - Poll card displays two large images (50/50 split-screen layout)
   - Poll shows either a curated "Poll of the Day" or featured active poll
   - Poll loads within 1.5 seconds on mobile 3G connection

2. **Anonymous Voting Capability**
   - Users can vote without authentication (anonymous voting)
   - Each browser session limited to one vote per poll (tracked via cookie/localStorage)
   - Vote submission provides immediate visual feedback (button press state)
   - Votes are stored in database with `anonymous_id` field

3. **Instant Vote Registration**
   - Click/tap on either option immediately registers vote
   - Optimistic UI update shows vote selected before API confirmation
   - If API call fails, show error toast and revert UI
   - Vote submission includes haptic feedback on mobile devices

4. **Real-time Vote Display**
   - After voting, poll transitions smoothly to results view (300ms fade animation)
   - Results show vote counts for both options
   - Percentage distribution calculated and displayed
   - Vote counts update in real-time via Supabase Realtime subscription
   - Multiple users voting simultaneously see live count updates

5. **Responsive Layout**
   - Mobile (<640px): Full-screen vertical layout, poll occupies 70% of viewport
   - Tablet (641-1024px): Centered poll card, max 800px wide
   - Desktop (1025px+): Centered poll card, max 1000px wide
   - All touch targets meet 44x44px minimum (WCAG AA)

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Existing functionality continues to work unchanged**
   - Poll creation flow at `/poll/create` remains functional
   - Individual poll viewing at `/poll/[id]` unaffected
   - Authentication system continues working for poll creation
   - Dashboard and profile pages unaffected

7. **New functionality follows existing patterns**
   - Uses existing `PollViewer` component logic (enhanced for homepage)
   - Leverages current Supabase Realtime subscriptions
   - Follows service layer pattern: `lib/services/polls.ts`
   - Uses existing error handling with `sonner` toast notifications

8. **Mobile-first implementation**
   - Homepage designed for mobile devices first
   - Progressive enhancement for larger screens
   - Touch interactions optimized for thumb reach
   - No horizontal scrolling required

**Quality Requirements:**

9. **Change is covered by appropriate tests**
   - Unit tests for new `HomePollCard` component
   - Integration tests for anonymous voting flow
   - E2E tests for homepage load and voting interaction
   - Real-time subscription tests

10. **Documentation is updated if needed**
    - README updated with homepage description
    - Component documentation for `HomePollCard`
    - Anonymous voting mechanism documented

11. **No regression in existing functionality verified**
    - Full test suite passes (unit, integration, E2E)
    - Existing poll viewing pages work correctly
    - Poll creation flow unaffected
    - Authentication system functional

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Replace `app/page.tsx` content with full-screen poll display
  - Reuse `PollViewer` component logic, create new `HomePollCard` wrapper
  - Implement anonymous voting using browser fingerprinting or session ID
  - Store `anonymous_id` in localStorage, send with vote API requests

- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Follow `/poll/[id]/page.tsx` structure for poll display
  - Use existing `usePoll` and `useRealtimeVotes` hooks
  - Leverage current vote API at `/api/polls/[id]/vote`

- **Key Constraints:**
  - No database schema changes (use existing `anonymous_id` field in `votes` table)
  - Performance budget: <1.5s First Contentful Paint on mobile 3G
  - Must maintain existing authentication flow (optional for viewing)

```

### Technical Implementation Details

**Anonymous Voting Implementation:**

```typescript
// lib/utils/anonymous-id.ts
export function getOrCreateAnonymousId(): string {
  const key = "thisorthat_anonymous_id";
  let id = localStorage.getItem(key);

  if (!id) {
    id = `anon_${crypto.randomUUID()}`;
    localStorage.setItem(key, id);
  }

  return id;
}
```

**API Route Update:**

```typescript
// app/api/polls/[id]/vote/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { choice, anonymous_id } = await request.json();

  // Check if user is authenticated
  const session = await getSession();
  const user_id = session?.user.id || null;

  // Require either user_id or anonymous_id
  if (!user_id && !anonymous_id) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Authentication or anonymous ID required" },
      { status: 400 },
    );
  }

  // Insert vote with either user_id or anonymous_id
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("votes")
    .insert({
      poll_id: pollId,
      user_id,
      anonymous_id,
      choice,
    })
    .select()
    .single();

  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

**Homepage Component Structure:**

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { HomePollCard } from '@/components/poll/HomePollCard';
import { LoadingSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';

export default async function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSkeleton />}>
        <HomePollCard />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Testing Standards

**Test File Location:**

- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/HomePollCard.test.tsx`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/anonymous-voting.test.tsx`
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/homepage-demo-poll.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**

- Unit/Integration: Vitest + React Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright
- Real-time: Mock Supabase Realtime subscriptions

**Key Test Scenarios:**

1. Homepage loads and displays demo poll
2. Anonymous user can vote without login
3. Vote is registered and stored correctly
4. Real-time vote updates work across sessions
5. Second vote attempt is prevented (same anonymous ID)
6. Optimistic UI update works correctly
7. Error handling for failed API calls
8. Transition animation plays smoothly
9. Responsive layout works on all breakpoints
10. Regression: Existing poll pages still work

### Performance Targets

- First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.5s on mobile 3G
- Time to Interactive (TTI): <3.5s on mobile 3G
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1
- Bundle size increase: <50KB (gzipped)

- Vote buttons have aria-labels
- Screen reader announces vote confirmation
- Focus indicators visible (3px Discord purple outline)
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (4.5:1)
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px

## Definition of Done

- [x] Homepage displays full-screen demo poll

- [x] Vote submission provides immediate feedback (haptic + animation)
- [x] Real-time vote counts update across sessions
- [x] Responsive layout works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [x] Performance optimizations implemented (Next.js Image, ISR caching)
