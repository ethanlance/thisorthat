# Story 5.6: Error Handling & User Feedback

## Overview

Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems that provide clear, helpful communication to users when things go wrong, while maintaining a positive user experience and enabling effective debugging and monitoring.

## User Stories

### As a user experiencing errors
- I want to understand what went wrong in clear, simple language
- I want to know what I can do to fix the problem or try again
- I want to feel confident that my data is safe even when errors occur
- I want to be able to report problems when I encounter them

### As a user providing feedback
- I want to easily report bugs or suggest improvements
- I want to know that my feedback is being heard and considered
- I want to see updates on issues I've reported
- I want to contribute to making the platform better

### As a developer/maintainer
- I want to quickly identify and fix issues when they occur
- I want to understand the context and impact of errors
- I want to prioritize fixes based on user impact and frequency
- I want to prevent similar issues from happening again

## Acceptance Criteria

2. **Error Recovery Options**
   - Users can retry failed operations with clear retry buttons
   - Alternative actions are suggested when primary actions fail
   - Users can navigate away from error states easily
   - Partial data is preserved when possible during errors

3. **Error Context & Help**
   - Error messages include relevant context about what the user was doing
   - Helpful links and resources are provided for common errors
   - Error codes are included for support purposes but not prominently displayed
   - Users can access additional help and support options

### Error Categories & Handling
4. **Network & Connectivity Errors**
   - Offline detection and appropriate messaging
   - Connection timeout handling with retry options
   - Server error handling with user-friendly messages

5. **Validation & Input Errors**
   - Form validation errors are clear and actionable
   - File upload errors explain size, type, and format requirements
   - Authentication and authorization errors are handled gracefully
   - Data validation errors provide specific guidance

6. **System & Unexpected Errors**
   - Unexpected errors are caught and handled gracefully
   - Error boundaries prevent entire app crashes
   - Fallback UI is shown when components fail to load
   - Critical errors are logged and reported automatically

### User Feedback System
7. **Bug Reporting**
   - Users can easily report bugs from any error state
   - Bug reports include relevant context and user actions
   - Screenshots and additional details can be attached
   - Bug reports are categorized and prioritized automatically

8. **Feature Requests**
   - Users can suggest new features and improvements
   - Feature requests are organized and tracked
   - Users can vote on and discuss feature requests
   - Popular requests are highlighted and considered for development

9. **Feedback Management**
   - Users can view the status of their feedback
   - Updates and responses are communicated to users
   - Feedback is organized and searchable
   - Duplicate feedback is identified and merged

### Error Monitoring & Analytics
10. **Error Tracking**
    - All errors are logged with relevant context
    - Error frequency and impact are tracked
    - User actions leading to errors are recorded
    - Error trends and patterns are identified

11. **Performance Monitoring**
    - Slow operations and timeouts are tracked
    - User experience metrics are monitored
    - Performance regressions are detected
    - System health is continuously monitored
