# Story 6.2: Discord-Inspired Design System & Animations

## User Story

As a **user voting on a poll**,
I want **a visually delightful, playful interface with celebration animations**,
So that **voting feels rewarding and the app reflects the Discord-inspired personality of the brand**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Homepage demo poll from Story 6.1, existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Technology: Tailwind CSS, CSS animations, React Client Components, canvas-confetti library
- Follows pattern: Existing Shadcn/ui component styling, Tailwind utility classes
- Touch points: Global styles, Tailwind config, poll components, button components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Discord Purple/Blue Color Palette**
   - Primary color: `#5865F2` (Discord purple) used for all primary CTAs
   - Primary dark: `#4752C4` for hover/pressed states
   - Primary light: `#7289DA` for secondary elements (50% opacity for trailing option)
   - Accent color: `#EB459E` (pink) for special moments and notifications
   - Color tokens added to Tailwind config as `primary`, `primary-dark`, `primary-light`, `accent`

2. **Poll Card Styling**
   - Poll images have rounded corners (12px border radius)
   - Option labels overlay with gradient background for readability
   - Winning option highlighted with subtle purple glow/border
   - Card shadows use purple-tinted shadows (#5865F2 at 15% opacity)
   - Clean, modern aesthetic matching Discord's design language

3. **Confetti Celebration Animation**
   - Triggers immediately after vote submission (on results reveal)
   - 20-30 colorful particles burst from center of screen
   - Colors: purple (#5865F2), blue (#7289DA), pink (#EB459E), white (#FFFFFF)
   - Duration: 2 seconds total with fade-out after 1.5s
   - Particles have gravity physics for natural fall
   - Only plays once per vote (not on page reload)

4. **Animated Progress Bars**
   - Results display animated progress bars overlaying poll images
   - Bars fill from 0% to final value with smooth animation (800ms ease-out cubic)
   - Leading option uses Discord purple (#5865F2)
   - Trailing option uses muted purple/gray (#7289DA at 50% opacity)
   - Staggered reveal: Option A bar → 100ms delay → Option B bar
   - Percentage labels visible with white text and shadow/outline

5. **Interactive Button States**
   - **Hover (desktop):** Scale 1.02, purple glow shadow intensifies (200ms transition)
   - **Pressed (all):** Scale 0.98, darker color (#4752C4), inner shadow (100ms transition)
   - **Focus:** 3px solid Discord purple (#5865F2) outline, visible for keyboard users
   - **Disabled:** 50% opacity, no interaction, cursor not-allowed
   - All transitions use ease-out curve for responsive feel

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Existing functionality continues to work unchanged**
   - Poll creation, viewing, and voting logic unaffected
   - Authentication system continues working
   - All existing components render correctly with new styles
   - Database queries and API routes unchanged

7. **New functionality follows existing patterns**
   - Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes (no custom CSS modules)
   - Follows Shadcn/ui component styling conventions
   - Colors defined in Tailwind config, referenced via utilities
   - Animations use CSS transitions and `@keyframes` where needed

8. **Accessibility compliance**
   - Confetti animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (disabled when set)
   - Progress bars animate faster (200ms) with reduced motion enabled
   - All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1)
   - Focus indicators never removed, always 3px visible outline

**Quality Requirements:**

9. **Change is covered by appropriate tests**
   - Unit tests for animation components
   - Visual regression tests for styled components
   - Accessibility tests for reduced motion support
   - Performance tests for animation frame rates

10. **Documentation is updated if needed**
    - Design system documentation with color palette
    - Animation guidelines for future components
    - Tailwind config documented

11. **No regression in existing functionality verified**
    - All existing styled components still render correctly
    - Tailwind utilities work across entire app
    - No CSS conflicts or style leaks
    - Bundle size increase acceptable (<15KB for confetti library)

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:**
  - Extend Tailwind config with new color tokens
  - Create animation utility classes in `globals.css`
  - Use `canvas-confetti` library (15KB gzipped) for celebration effect
  - Implement animations as reusable React components

- **Existing Pattern Reference:**
  - Follow Shadcn/ui button component styling patterns
  - Use existing Tailwind responsive utilities (`hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`)
  - Match existing animation patterns from loading spinners

- **Key Constraints:**
  - Confetti library lazy-loaded after vote (not in initial bundle)
  - All animations GPU-accelerated (`transform` and `opacity` only)
  - Animation performance: 60fps on modern devices, 30fps minimum
  - Respect user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

### Technical Implementation Details

**Tailwind Color Configuration:**

```typescript
// tailwind.config.ts
export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: "#5865F2",
          dark: "#4752C4",
          light: "#7289DA",
        },
        accent: "#EB459E",
        neutral: {
          900: "#23272A",

          300: "#E3E5E8",
          100: "#F2F3F5",
        },
      },
      boxShadow: {
        primary: "0 4px 12px rgba(88, 101, 242, 0.15)",
        "primary-lg": "0 8px 24px rgba(88, 101, 242, 0.2)",
      },
      animation: {
        "progress-fill":
          "progress-fill 800ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) forwards",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "progress-fill": {
          "0%": { width: "0%" },
          "100%": { width: "var(--progress-width)" },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**Confetti Component:**

```typescript
// components/poll/ConfettiCelebration.tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export function ConfettiCelebration({ active }: { active: boolean }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!active) return;

    // Check reduced motion preference
    const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia(
      "(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)",
    ).matches;
    if (prefersReducedMotion) return;

    // Lazy load confetti library
    import("canvas-confetti").then((confetti) => {
      confetti.default({
        particleCount: 30,
        spread: 70,
        origin: { y: 0.6 },
        colors: ["#5865F2", "#7289DA", "#EB459E", "#FFFFFF"],
        gravity: 1,
        scalar: 1.2,
        drift: 0,
        ticks: 200,
      });
    });
  }, [active]);

  return null; // No visual element, just triggers animation
}
```

**Animated Progress Bar:**

```typescript
// components/poll/AnimatedProgressBar.tsx
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface AnimatedProgressBarProps {
  percentage: number;
  isLeading: boolean;
  delay?: number; // Stagger animation
}

export function AnimatedProgressBar({
  percentage,
  isLeading,
  delay = 0
}: AnimatedProgressBarProps) {
  const [animate, setAnimate] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setAnimate(true), delay);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [delay]);

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full h-2 bg-neutral-300 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
      <div
        className={cn(
          "h-full rounded-full transition-all",
          isLeading ? "bg-primary" : "bg-primary-light/50",
          animate && "motion-safe:animate-progress-fill"
        )}
        style={{
          '--progress-width': `${percentage}%`,
          width: animate ? `${percentage}%` : '0%',
        } as React.CSSProperties}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Button State Styling:**

```tsx
// components/ui/button.tsx (Shadcn/ui extended)
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center... transition-all duration-200",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: cn(
          "bg-primary text-white",
          "hover:bg-primary-dark hover:scale-102 hover:shadow-primary",
          "active:scale-98",
          "focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-3 focus-visible:outline-primary",
          "disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed",
        ),
        // ... other variants
      },
    },
  },
);
```

**Reduced Motion Support:**

```css
/* app/globals.css */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }

  .confetti-canvas {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

6. Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA
7. Keyboard navigation shows focus indicators
8. Animation performance maintains 60fps
9. Confetti library lazy loads (not in initial bundle)
10. No CSS conflicts with existing components

### Performance Targets

- Animation FPS: 60fps on modern devices, 30fps minimum
- Confetti library: Lazy loaded, <15KB gzipped
- CSS bundle size increase: <5KB
- Progress bar animation: 800ms perceived as smooth
- Button interactions: <100ms response time

### Accessibility Requirements

- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected for all animations
