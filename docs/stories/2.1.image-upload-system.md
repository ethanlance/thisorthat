## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on Story 1.4 (Basic UI Components & Layout) which established the UI component library and mobile-responsive design. The image upload system will use the existing UI components and follow the mobile-first design patterns established in the previous stories.

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for image uploads and CDN delivery
- **Image Processing**: Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- **File Handling**: HTML5 File API with drag-and-drop support
- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components for upload interface

### Integration Points

[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

- **Supabase Storage**: Integrates with existing Supabase project from Story 1.2
- **UI Components**: Uses Button, Card, Form, and Alert components from Story 1.4
- **Authentication**: Leverages AuthContext from Story 1.3 for user-specific storage
- **Mobile Design**: Follows mobile-first patterns established in Story 1.4

### Technical Implementation

[Source: technical-specifications.md#image-upload-system]

#### Supabase Storage Configuration

```typescript
// lib/storage/image-upload.ts
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";

export const uploadPollImage = async (
  file: File,
  pollId: string,
  option: "a" | "b",
): Promise<string> => {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const fileExt = file.name.split(".").pop();
  const fileName = `${pollId}-${option}.${fileExt}`;

  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from("poll-images")
    .upload(fileName, file, {
      cacheControl: "3600",
      upsert: false,
    });

  if (error) throw error;
  return data.path;
};
```

#### Image Validation

```typescript
// lib/storage/image-validation.ts
export const validateImageFile = (file: File): ValidationResult => {
  const maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
  const allowedTypes = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/webp"];

  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    return { valid: false, error: "File size must be less than 5MB" };
  }

  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: "Only JPEG, PNG, and WebP images are allowed",
    };
  }

  return { valid: true };
};
```

#### Upload Component

```typescript
// components/upload/ImageUpload.tsx
interface ImageUploadProps {
  onImageSelect: (file: File) => void;
  onUploadComplete: (url: string) => void;
  onError: (error: string) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export default function ImageUpload({
  onImageSelect,
  onUploadComplete,
  onError,
  disabled = false,
}: ImageUploadProps) {
  // Implementation with drag-and-drop and file picker
}
```
